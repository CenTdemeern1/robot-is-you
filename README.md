# About

A fun bot based on the indie game [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/) (by Arvi Teikkari). This bot was written with the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Python 3.x.

# Functionality

A list of commands can be seen using the `help` command. (By default, the bot has a prefix of `+`.)

This bot primarily features rendering and animation of tiles in *Baba Is You*, through the `tile` and `rule` commands, as seen below. The command has many options, detailed in `help tile`.
